                In the book "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People," Steven Covey talks about the habit of
                "Putting First Things First," and suggests that tasks on the To-Do list be broken out into four quadrants:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item">Quadrant I: Important / Urgent</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Quadrant II: Important / Not Urgent</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Quadrant III: Not Important / Urgent</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Quadrant IV: Not Important / Not Urgent</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="lead">
                Using this application, you can add, edit and delete tasks in a database to help you follow Steven's principals.
                Enjoy the app!
